# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Library Management System (LMS)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed description of the requirements for the Library Management System (LMS). It will outline the functional and non-functional requirements, design constraints, and other pertinent information needed for the development and deployment of the system.

### 1.2 Scope
The LMS is intended to automate the management of a library's resources. The system will handle book inventory, member registrations, and transactions such as book issues and returns. It aims to improve efficiency, reduce manual errors, and provide a user-friendly interface for both library staff and members.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The LMS is a standalone system that will replace the existing manual process of managing library resources. It will interact with a relational database to store and retrieve information. The system will have a web-based user interface and may later include mobile support.

### 2.2 Product Functions
- **Book Management**: Add, update, delete, and search for books.
- **Member Management**: Register, update, delete, and search for library members.
- **Transaction Management**: Issue and return books, track due dates and fines.
- **Authentication**: Login and registration for library staff and members.
- **Reporting**: Generate reports on library usage, book inventory, and transactions.

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
- **Library Staff**: Manage books, members, and transactions. Requires a user-friendly interface and access to administrative functions.
- **Library Members**: Search for books, check their account status, and view transaction history. Requires a simple interface for ease of use.
- **Administrators**: Oversee the entire system, manage user roles, and access all functionalities. Requires a comprehensive interface with advanced options.

### 2.4 Operating Environment
- **Web Application**: Compatible with modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- **Database**: MySQL or PostgreSQL.
- **Server**: Runs on a Java-based server (e.g., Apache Tomcat).

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
- **Security**: Must comply with standard security practices, including encryption for sensitive data.
- **Performance**: Must handle a high number of concurrent users and transactions efficiently.
- **Scalability**: Should be designed to scale as the library grows.

### 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies
- Users have basic knowledge of computers and web browsing.
- Reliable internet connection is available.
- The system will be hosted on a secure server.
